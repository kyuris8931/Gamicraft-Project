# Gamicraft - Project Status & Roadmap v2.0

Last Updated: May 8, 2025

Status: Draft Revision - Reflecting New Architectural Vision & Priorities

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1. Name & Concept Recap

- **Name:** Gamicraft
    
- **Concept:** A modular gamification framework integrating real-life productivity/habits with custom digital experiences. The new vision emphasizes "full code" game modules for better collaboration and Tasker as a central orchestrator managing a core JSON data system.
    

### 1.2. Core Philosophies (Recap)

- "Growth to Win"
    
- "Productivity as Privilege"
    
- High Modularity & Customization (now including "full code" modules)
    
- User Empowerment ("Your Game, Your Rules")
    
- Varied Play Sessions (short interactions & deeper gameplay)
    

### 1.3. Lead Developer & Team Structure

- **Lead:** Kyuris
    
- **Team:** Currently Solo Developer.
    

### 1.4. Core Technology Stack (Revised Architecture)

- **Platform:** Primarily Android, with "full code" modules potentially being cross-platform (e.g., PWAs using JavaScript).
    
- **Core Data Backbone:** Central JSON data file(s) managed by Tasker.
    
- **Core Orchestrator & System Bridge:** Tasker (managing JSON, LifeUp integration, module communication, external app bridging).
    
- **Game & Interactive Modules:**
    
    - **Primary Focus:** "Full Code" modules (e.g., JavaScript-based PWAs/WebViews for TBC) for core gameplay.
        
    - **Legacy/Utility:** Tasker profiles/tasks and KLWP for simpler utilities or ambient displays.
        
- **Presentation Layer (Ambient):** KLWP for homescreen dashboard.
    
- **Development & Collaboration:** GitHub for "full code" modules and core documentation (ideally in Markdown `.md` format).
    

## 2. Current Status (As of May 2025)

### 2.1. Development Stage

- **Stage:** Active Development & Architectural Transition.
    
- **Progress:**
    
    - Core architectural vision significantly revised towards a distributed model ("full code" modules + Tasker orchestrator + Central JSON).
        
    - Internal documentation update initiated (Master Document v2.0 drafted).
        
    - Development of KLWP-based TBC and IDLE Life Tokens (including tutorials/setup guides) has been **paused/deprioritized**.
        
    - Novel "Gamicraft: Manifest Reality" continues with multiple chapters published on Wattpad.
        
    - Daily content creation strategy for TikTok/Shorts ("1000 Day Gamicraft Challenge") initiated.
        
    - The TBC _concept showcase video_ (demonstrating LifeUp integration, real-world rewards) remains a valid promotional idea, though the underlying technology for the TBC module itself will be "full code".
        

### 2.2. Key Completed Milestones (Conceptual & Foundational)

- Initial Gamicraft concept and lore established.
    
- KLWP-based TBC prototype developed (served as a proof-of-concept and learning experience).
    
- Initial communication platforms established (Discord).
    
- Novel initiated as a primary narrative vehicle.
    

### 2.3. Platform Presence

- **GitHub (Gamicraft-Project):** Primary hub for future "full code" modules and core documentation. Transitioning to Markdown for key internal documents is recommended for better AI integration and version control.
    
- **Discord:** Server established for community interaction and updates.
    
- **Wattpad:** Novel "Gamicraft: Manifest Reality" actively published.
    
- **TikTok/YouTube Shorts:** Daily content creation in progress.
    
- **LifeUp:** Used for personal task management and as a core integration point for Gamicraft.
    

## 3. Key Challenges & Constraints

- **Solo Developer Limitations:** Time, diverse skill set required for "full code" development, velocity, burnout risk.
    
- **Architectural Transition:** Effort required to refactor concepts and plan development for "full code" modules.
    
- **Learning Curve:** Potential new technologies or frameworks for "full code" module development.
    
- **Resource Scarcity (Financial):** Remains a factor.
    
- **Visibility & Traction:** Ongoing effort to build an initial audience.
    
- **Documentation Burden:** Maintaining updated internal and (future) public documentation for the new architecture.
    

## 4. Vision & Strategic Goals

- **Long-Term Vision:** Establish Gamicraft as a prominent, flexible, and collaborative framework for deep real-life gamification.
    
- **Community Goals:** Cultivate an active, engaged community around the framework, lore, and potentially contributing to "full code" modules.
    
- **User Empowerment Goals:** Empower users via customization and by providing a clear path for potential contributions to open-source modules.
    
- **Sustainability & Growth Goals:** Achieve project sustainability.
    
- **Narrative Integration:** Continue leveraging the novel and daily content to explain the Gamicraft philosophy and engage users.
    

## 5. Near-Term Roadmap (Next 1-3 Months - Revised Priorities)

### 5.1. Foundational Refinement (Top Priority)

- **Task:** Finalize updates to core internal documentation reflecting the new architecture (Master Document v2.0, this Project Status & Roadmap v2.0, Development & Repository Guide v2.0).
    
    - **Action:** Convert key internal documents to Markdown (`.md`) and organize them in the GitHub repository for better AI access and version control.
        
- **Task:** Define the technical architecture and communication protocol for the first "full code" TBC module (e.g., PWA/WebView with JavaScript, how it interfaces with Tasker and the Central JSON).
    
    - **Action:** Create a new internal document: `TBC Module - Full Code Architecture v1.0.md`.
        

### 5.2. "Full Code" TBC - Proof of Concept & Showcase

- **Task:** Develop a basic prototype of the "Full Code" TBC module.
    
    - **Focus:** Core turn management, basic attack logic, HP system, and communication with Tasker (sending/receiving simple JSON data). UI can be very basic initially.
        
    - **Technology:** JavaScript (PWA/WebView).
        
- **Task:** Produce the TBC _concept showcase video_ (as previously planned).
    
    - **Note:** This video will demonstrate the _philosophy_ of Gamicraft TBC (LifeUp integration, real-world interactions). It can use mock-ups or the early "full code" TBC prototype visuals if ready. It will clarify that the KLWP TBC is a precursor and development is shifting to a more robust "full code" version.
        

### 5.3. Content Creation & Community Engagement

- **Task:** Consistently execute the daily content strategy for TikTok/Shorts ("1000 Day Gamicraft Challenge").
    
- **Task:** Continue writing and publishing chapters for the "Gamicraft: Manifest Reality" novel on Wattpad.
    
- **Task:** Engage with any emerging community on Discord.
    

### 5.4. Deprioritized / On Hold

- Development of setup guides and tutorials for KLWP-based TBC and IDLE Life Tokens.
    
- Further feature development on KLWP-based TBC.
    

## 6. AI Collaboration Model (Adjusted Focus)

The AI collaboration model remains largely the same (as per `Project Status & Roadmap v1.1`), with an adjusted focus:

- **Strategic Planning & Documentation:** AI assists in refining architectural ideas, drafting/updating core documentation (like this document and the Master Document) to reflect new plans.
    
- **"Full Code" Module Development:**
    
    - AI can assist with boilerplate code generation for JavaScript modules.
        
    - AI can help debug and refactor JavaScript code.
        
    - AI can assist in designing data structures (JSON) for communication between Tasker and "full code" modules.
        
- **Daily Content Creation:** A separate AI assistant (or a dedicated session) will help with daily content narrative generation based on Kyuris's briefings (as per `gamicraft_daily_content_ai_brief_v1.md`).
    
- **GitHub Integration:** If AI tools are linked to the GitHub repository (containing `.md` docs and `.js` code), AI can provide more context-aware assistance.
