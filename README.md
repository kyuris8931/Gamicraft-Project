# Gamicraft - Modular Gamification Systems

**Gamicraft isn't just another gamification app. It's an open framework for building** _**your own**_ **game experiences, powered by** _**your own**_ **life.** It aims to bridge the gap between real-world effort and meaningful digital rewards, transforming mundane tasks into epic adventures.

### 🔥 Now Playable: Turn-Based Combat (TBC) v1.0 is LIVE!

After 1.5 years of development, the first core Gamicraft module is now available. Dive into a challenging tactical RPG where your real-life progress gives you the edge you need to win.

**Outsmart your foes, don't just defeat them. Make them waste a turn!**

### 💡 The Gamicraft Philosophy

Gamicraft is built on a few core principles that set it apart:

- **🌱 Growth to Win:** Your real-world progress is the _only_ way to truly advance. The more productive you are, the more powerful you become.
- **🎟️ Productivity as Privilege:** Challenging tasks aren't chores; they are opportunities you unlock using in-game resources, adding a layer of motivation. 
- **🧩 High Modularity:** Gamicraft is a framework, not a single game. Mix and match modules to create the experience that's right for you.
- **🎮 Your Game, Your Rules:** The framework is highly customizable. You are encouraged to tweak the systems to match your personal goals and playstyle.
    

### 🛠️ How It Works: The Tech Stack

Gamicraft runs on the Android platform, powered by a synergy of powerful automation tools:

- **LifeUp:** The primary data source for tracking real-life tasks, habits, and attributes.  
- **Tasker:** The central "brain" of Gamicraft, acting as the automation engine and core logic hub. 
- **AutoTools Web Screen:** The UI/UX layer, providing a modern and interactive interface for game modules like the TBC.

### ❤️ A Note from the Creator

> Hi, I'm Kyuris, the solo developer behind Gamicraft. Thank you for being here. This project is more than just code to me; it's a 1.5-year journey of passion, struggle, and perseverance.
> 
> Gamicraft started as a simple idea and has evolved through countless iterations—from basic API concepts, to Tasker widgets, to a KLWP interface that ended in a tragic hardware failure. This version, built on Web Screen, is the culmination of all those lessons.
> 
> To be completely transparent, this journey has been incredibly difficult. I truly love working on this project, but that passion is often tested by severe financial strain. I've pursued this with no income, sometimes taking on manual labor jobs as a construction worker to make ends meet, saving every Rupiah earned.
> 
> This v1.0 release is a monumental milestone for me. It's the first time a core Gamicraft module is truly realized and ready for you to experience.
> 
> If this project, its philosophy, or its story resonates with you, and if you have the means, any support you could offer would be more than just appreciated—it would be a lifeline. It would help keep the internet on to continue development and prove that this journey is worth taking.
> 
> Thank you for reading, and I genuinely hope you enjoy the world I'm building.
