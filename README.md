**Tagline:** "Modular Gamification Systems"

Gamicraft is a unique gamification project aiming to blend real-life productivity with engaging, custom-built mini-game modules. Run primarily through Android apps **LifeUp**, **Tasker**, and **KLWP**, it turns daily tasks and habits into fuel for actual gameplay.

## Core Philosophy: Growth to Win

Unlike traditional games or simple gamification apps, Gamicraft embodies a **"Growth to Win"** philosophy. Real-world progress (completing tasks, exercising, learning) directly enhances your capabilities within the game modules. The core loop involves:
1.  **Productivity:** Earns resources (Coins, EXP) & passively generates Tokens based on LifeUp Attributes.
2.  **Gameplay:** Use resources to engage with modules (e.g., Turn-Based Combat, Virtual Pets) or acquire "Tickets" for privileged productive activities.
3.  **Rewards:** Gain in-game items, real-life treats, or progress towards larger goals.
4.  **Empowerment:** Improved attributes generate more passive resources, creating a positive feedback loop.

## Visual Style

Gamicraft utilizes a distinct **blueprint theme** with white stroke objects and hatching shader details for a technical, design-oriented aesthetic.
