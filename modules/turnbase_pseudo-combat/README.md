# Gamicraft - Turn-Based Combat (TBC) Module

**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Status:** First Public Release

Welcome to the Turn-Based Combat (TBC) module for Gamicraft! This isn't just another RPG. It's an experience where **your real-world progress directly empowers your heroes in-game.**

This module is the first implementation of Gamicraft's core philosophy: "Growth to Win". Get ready for a challenging tactical battlefield where every decision matters, and victory feels truly earned.

### âœ¨ Key Features

- **Deep Real-Life Integration:** Your character's strength doesn't just come from in-game grinding. Complete your tasks in **LifeUp**, hit your **exercise** goals, and watch your character grow genuinely stronger.
    
- **Tactical Combat System:** Utilize the unique **Pseudo-Position System** to manipulate the battlefield. Outsmart your enemies, not just overpower them, by strategically making them miss their turns.
    
- **Team Resource Management:** Share a single pool of **Skill Points (SP)** with your entire team. Generate SP with basic attacks and spend it wisely to unleash game-changing skills.
    
- **'High-Risk, High-Reward' Design:** Every hero has a unique role. Master skills with difficult conditions for incredible payoffs. There are no useless heroes, only undiscovered strategies.
    
- **Meaningful Gacha & Item System:** Use the **Coins** you earn from your productivity to open "SchrÃ¶dinger's Cache". Obtain powerful consumable items that can turn the tide of the most difficult battles.
