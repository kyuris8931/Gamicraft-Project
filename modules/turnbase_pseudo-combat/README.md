# Gamicraft - Turn-Based Combat (TBC) Module

**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Status:** First Public Release

Welcome to the Turn-Based Combat (TBC) module for Gamicraft! This isn't just another RPG. It's an experience where **your real-world progress directly empowers your heroes in-game.**

This module is the first implementation of Gamicraft's core philosophy: "Growth to Win". Get ready for a challenging tactical battlefield where every decision matters, and victory feels truly earned.

### âœ¨ Key Features

- **Deep Real-Life Integration:** Your character's strength doesn't just come from in-game grinding. Complete your tasks in **LifeUp**, hit your **exercise** goals, and watch your character grow genuinely stronger.
    
- **Tactical Combat System:** Utilize the unique **Pseudo-Position System** to manipulate the battlefield. Outsmart your enemies, not just overpower them, by strategically making them miss their turns.

### A Note from the Creator

Hi, I'm Kyuris, the solo developer behind Gamicraft. Thank you for being here. This project is more than just code to me; it's a 1.5-year journey of passion, struggle, and perseverance.

Gamicraft started as a simple idea: what if our daily habits could power a real game? It began with basic concepts, using LifeUp's API to simulate farming or battles through item descriptions. For months, that was the core.

Then, it evolved. The first real module, `IDLE Life Tokens`, was born, using Tasker widgets as its interfaceâ€”a small step forward. The vision grew, and I moved to using KLWP for a richer display, pushing my device to its limits until a system update tragically sent it into a bootloop, a stark reminder of the challenges of indie development.

Now, after all that, we've arrived here: a fully functional Turn-Based Combat module running on a Web Screen. Every line of code, every pixel, every debugging session (and there were many painful ones), and every video edit was done by me, alone, often with the support of AI assistants but always driven by a singular vision.

To be completely transparent, this journey has been incredibly difficult. It's been pursued without any income, often facing misunderstanding from those who see only someone "playing on the computer," not someone building a world.

This v1.0 release is a monumental milestone for me. It's the first time a core Gamicraft module is truly ready for others to experience.

If this project, its philosophy, or its story resonates with you, and if you have the means, any support you could offer would be more than just appreciatedâ€”it would be a lifeline. It would help keep the internet on to continue development and prove that this journey is worth taking.

Thank you for reading, and I genuinely hope you enjoy the world I'm building
